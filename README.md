# Skin Cancer Detection

## OVERVIEW
This project described here focuses on the prediction and analysis of various types
of skin cancers and skin conditions. It also provides a platform for both, patients,
and doctors to connect, predict and analyze medical anomalies.
The application is built to be user-friendly, fast, efficient, and cross-platform.

## Objectives
- Given a skin image as an input, we predict whether it is a type of cancer or
just some kind of allergy. Depending upon the severity level, the patient will
be able to contact a doctor. They will also be able to clarify their doubts
using the chatbot.
- A forum for the doctors, using which they will be able to connect to discuss
the patients’ cases.

## Scope
- A complete end to end working application that provides cancer/skin allergy prediction and severity level.

## In Scope:
- The application would be able to recall and understand the queries of the patient.
- Patient experience will be improved and the need to schedule an appointment
  for basic symptoms will be eliminated saving a lot of time.

## Out of Scope:
- The expertise and accuracy of a doctor cannot be compared to any application.

## Motivation
- Patients often have to wait for a lot of time to schedule an appointment, get
themselves checked, wait for results, and it is a waste of time if the patient
isn’t positive at the end.

## Applications
- The testing and prediction part becomes easier and more informative for
both, the patient, and the doctor.
- The tedious task of making appointments is eliminated.
- This can be used by multiple hospitals for easy transfer of patients’ cases and
connection for doctors.
